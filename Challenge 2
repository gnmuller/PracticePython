#Take a list, say for example this one:

#a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

#Okay so again if I wanted to use classes, I could. But the list given is really short, and pre-defined, but whatever
#Okay so one idea is to sort the list, and then iterate through the list

def ListFindLessThenFive (list):
  list.sort()
  NewListLessThenFive = []
  for i in list:
    if i < 5:
      NewListLessThenFive.append(i)
  return print(NewListLessThenFive)

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89] 
ListFindLessThenFive(a)
