#Using the requests and BeautifulSoup Python libraries, 
#print to the screen the full text of the article on this website: https://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture
-----
#So the first thing that needs to happen is a request has to be made between the website and the code

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
page = requests.get("https://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/monica-lewinsky-humiliation-culture")
page

#Next is to examine the structre of the page

page.content

#yikes this ugly and gross

ArticleParsed = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
#print(ArticleParsed.prettify())

#Still not great, but better
#Next step is to actually parse this out, so let's start with the paragraphs
ArticleParsedList = ArticleParsed.find_all('p', text = True)

#This is good, but still needs some actual stripping of the "Useless" Computer language

for i in ArticleParsedList:
  print (i.get_text(strip = True))
