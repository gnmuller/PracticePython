#The aim of this challenge is to write our own function called randomOddNumber() to
#generate a random odd number within a given range and a another function called randomEvenNumber()
#to generate a random even number. Both functions will take two parameters, the lower and higher values of the range.

#OKay so writing random Odd number, and an random even number both need parameters
#so, lets say I give it 1, and 100
#Isn't there something with stepping
#There is defintly something here with Modulus
#If you divide every number by two then it becomes even
def  randomOddNumber(lownum, highnum):
  lownum = lownum //2
  highnum = highnum //2
  number = random.randint(lownum, highnum)
  number = (number*2) + 1
  return number

oddNumber = randomOddNumber(0,100) 
print(oddNumber)


import random

#Method #2: Using an algorithm based on iteration
#So it itereate using modules
def randomOddNumber(a,b):
  number = random.randint(a,b)
  while number % 2 == 0:
    number = random.randint(a,b)
  
  return number
  
oddNumber = randomOddNumber(0,100) 
print(oddNumber)


#Same as the one above, but instead of a new random number, just take the even number, and plus 1
#Method #3: Using an algorithm based on selection
def randomOddNumber(a,b):
  number = random.randint(a,b-1)
  if number % 2 == 0:
    number = number + 1
  
  return number
  
oddNumber = randomOddNumber(0,100) 
print(oddNumber)
