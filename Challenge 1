#So this first part is asking the user to import something
#It is going to be caputerd as a string, and a small variable likely 2 digits.
#I can write a function that converts the age to a year, and into a year of when they will turn one hundred. 
##I think it would be cool to get the current year, and to subtract and do it that way.

    print("You will turn 100 in the year " + str(AgeDateMinus))

InputName = input("Enter Your Name: " )
