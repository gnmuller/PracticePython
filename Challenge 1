#So, this first problem is: Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
#Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

#So this first part is asking the user to import something
#It is going to be caputerd as a string, and a small variable likely 2 digits.
#I can write a function that converts the age to a year, and into a year of when they will turn one hundred. 
##I think it would be cool to get the current year, and to subtract and do it that way. 



class TurnOneHundred: 
  today = date.today()
  todayDate = today.strftime("%d/%m/%Y")
  TodayYear = todayDate[6:]
  def __init__(self, name, age, date):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.date = date
  def FindOneHundredYears(self, age, date):
    AgeDateMinus = (100 - int(self.age)) + int(self.date)
    print("You will turn 100 in the year " + str(AgeDateMinus))

InputName = input("Enter Your Name: " )
InputAge = input("Enter Your Age: ")  


Person1 = TurnOneHundred(InputName, InputAge, TodayYear)
Person1.FindOneHundredYears(InputAge, TodayYear)
