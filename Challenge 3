#Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). 
#Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.


#So, the first thing is to create a random number between 1 and 9
#i also have to decide what is to high or to low, I want to do four quadrants. 
#So if the answer is 5 +/-2 would be close high/low +/-4 far high/low. I am also going to add a 4+ since the numbers aren't that big, could maybe divide them if larger
#Okay so, I think need to add whether or not the number is actually higher or lower.
